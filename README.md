# angr_install
Simple script to create virtual environment by venv and install angr along with all required modules.

The following components must be installed for the script to works correctly:

  - `python3` (3.10 - 3.13)
  - `pip`
  - `venv` (usually already installed with Python 3.x)

This script will create a virtual environment named "angr_env" in execution directory and install all reaquired modules. After that, the script will display a short guide on managing virtual environments.

## Tested on

- **Kali Linux Rolling 2024.3** with Python 3.12.8
- **Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS** with Python 3.10.12
